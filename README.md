***A bit weird but Google Auto Complete API has a max usage of 1 request per day for free users***

## FUNCTIONALITY

- Tap on search address button to search for an address
- Type in an address in the textfield, when the letters reach more than 3 it will request an auto complete from Google
- Supports both portrait and landscape modes

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

- Everything is built using native Swift, used some of my protocols & sub classes from my previous projects
- Focus on subclassing, creation of custom views
- Coordinator pattern
- MVVM pattern
